# 42 Pool - C Programming Exercises

This repository contains all the C programming exercises completed during the 42 Network's Piscine program. These projects helped me build a strong foundation in the C language, memory management, and problem-solving.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder corresponds to a module from the piscine:

- `C00-not-all-ex/` – Basic syntax, `printf`, basic functions.
- `C01-1337/` – Pointers, memory manipulation, string functions.
- `C02/` – Arrays, string manipulation.
- `C03-all-ex/` – String operations, memory operations.
- `C04-all-ex/` – Basic memory manipulation with `malloc`.
- `C05-1337/` – Recursion, factorial, power, Fibonacci.
- `C06-1337/` – File I/O basics.
- `C07-/` – Sorting, binary search, advanced string manipulation.
- `C08/` – Structs and function pointers.
- `C09/` – Advanced structs and macros.
- `C10/ex00/` – File parsing and manipulation.
- `C11-not-all-ex/` – Memory allocation strategies.
- `C12../` – Custom data structures (possibly linked lists or trees).
- `C13/` – Final complex challenge projects.

## 🛠 Technologies

- Language: **C (98%)**
- Build Tools: **Makefile (1.8%)**, **Shell scripts (0.2%)**

## 🚀 How to Use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MistaaOlivaaa/42_pool.git
cd 42_pool/CXX/ # Replace CXX with the folder you want to work in
